## This list was started based on #scenefromabove podcast lunchtime discussions

This is being extended frequently in May 2020. Please note that this is <b>not</b> offically an awesome list (yet). Please help me to get it there by contributing and commenting. [guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md)

<b> Update May 2020</b> We now have almost 300 links/resources. The focus at the moment is resorting and ordering all these links and potentially reclassifiying where needed. The Geospatial companies section has been regrouped. next on reorganisation is breaking up of '`Python` processing of optical imagery non deep learning' section. 

Annotations are based on the headers - where available - on the github accounts

# [Scene From Above Podcast](http://scenefromabove.org/)

</div>

Alastair Graham [@ajggeoger](https://twitter.com/ajggeoger) and Andrew Cutts [@map_andrew](https://twitter.com/map_andrew) come together to present an informal podcast [@eoscenefrom](https://twitter.com/eoscenefrom) looking at the world of modern remote sensing and EO.
Fuelled by their passion for all things raster and geospatial, the #scenefromabove podcast aims to be a mix of news, opinion, discussion and interviews. <br>

#### Start Here

OpenEO covers many of the bases, hard to know whether to break it into different categories, it has many components. At present I mention it here at the start only.<br>

- [Open EO](https://openeo.org/) - openEO develops an open API to connect `R`, `Python`, `JavaScript` and other clients to big Earth observation cloud back-ends in a simple and unified way.

You may also wish to navigate a search of the terms `satellite-imagery` and `earth-observation` to get the lastest list of topics that have these terms in their headers

Detecting roads can be an important factor in predicting further development of cities, and this concept plays a major role in GeoArchitect (A project which I started). Segmentation of roads is important to map-based applications and is used for finding distances or shortest routes between two places.

## A footnote on awesome
There are many awesome lists relating to 'Geo'. I use that term as widely as possible. This list is not meant to replace these lists. Earth Observation is still <b>way</b> behind the GIS world in terms of audience, reach, number of users etc. Things are changing though, by bringing these links together I hope you can see that there has been so much progress in the last 5 years. I do hope these links are helpful espcially to those who are new to Earth Observation, but also to people like me who with several years of experience think they may have seen it all - we haven't and there is still so much to learn. Earth Observation is not just an academic 'thing' or a basemap anymore, it forms the basis for a growing and diverse business environment. Lets embrace this.

Finally, I wanted to acknowledge a couple of awesome Earth Observation lists that you may list to check out:
